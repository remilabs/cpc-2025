## Problem Statement

TODO: Add option to go from (w,h) -> (h,w).

Given a large piece of roofing underlayment in rectangular shape with dimensions h x w, where h is the height and w is the width, fold the shape so its dimensions are h1 x w1 in the minimum number of moves. The rectangle can only be folded parallel to its edges, and after folding, the dimensions should be integers. 

## Input Format

The first line of input will be 2 space-separated integers W and H, the original dimensions of the roofing underlayment.

The second line of input will be 2 space-separated integers W2 and H2, the desired dimensions of the roofing underlayment.

## Output Format

Output a single integer -- the minimum number of folds to get from dimensions (w,h) to (w2,h2). It is always possible to get the desired dimensions.

## Constraints

1 <= W,H,W2,H2 <= 1,000,000
